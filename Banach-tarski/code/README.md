# A Formal Proof of the Banach-Tarski theorem:

## Main reference:  Weston, T.. “THE BANACH-TARSKI PARADOX.” (2003).

## Goal: Prove the Banach-Tarski theorem in ACL2(r)

Proof is divided into four stages:

#### Stage1: Prove the Hausdorff paradox

#### Stage2: Prove the Banach-Tarski Theorem for the surface of the sphere

#### Stage3: Prove the Banach-Tarski theorem for a solid ball except for the orgin

#### Stage4: Prove the Banach-Tarski theorem for the entire ball

##### Progress:

Stage1:
Hausdorff Paradox statement: There is a countable set D that is a subset of S^2 such that S^2-D can be divided into 5 pieces which can then be rotated to form 2 copies of S^2-D.

Proved the equivalence between different partitions of S^2-D. hausdorff-paradox.lisp contains the proof.

To Do: Prove set D is countable.
